/**
   File Name:          7.2.js
   ECMA Section:       7.2 Line Terminators
   Description:        - readability
   - separate tokens
   - may occur between any two tokens
   - cannot occur within any token, not even a string
   - affect the process of automatic semicolon insertion.

   white space characters are:
   unicode     name            formal name     string representation
   \u000A      line feed       <LF>            \n
   \u000D      carriage return <CR>            \r

   this test uses onerror to capture line numbers.  because
   we use on error, we can only have one test case per file.

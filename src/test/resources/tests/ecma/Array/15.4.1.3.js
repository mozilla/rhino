/**
   File Name:          15.4.1.3.js
   ECMA Section:       15.4.1.3 Array()

   Description:        When Array is called as a function rather than as a
   constructor, it creates and initializes a new array
   object.  Thus, the function call Array(...) is
   equivalent to the object creationi new Array(...) with
   the same arguments.

   An array is created and returned as if by the
   expression new Array(len).

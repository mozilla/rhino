/**
   File Name:          11.2.1-2.js
   ECMA Section:       11.2.1 Property Accessors
   Description:

   Properties are accessed by name, using either the dot notation:
   MemberExpression . Identifier
   CallExpression . Identifier

   or the bracket notation:    MemberExpression [ Expression ]
   CallExpression [ Expression ]

   The dot notation is explained by the following syntactic conversion:
   MemberExpression . Identifier
   is identical in its behavior to
   MemberExpression [ <identifier-string> ]
   and similarly
   CallExpression . Identifier
   is identical in its behavior to
   CallExpression [ <identifier-string> ]
   where <identifier-string> is a string literal containing the same sequence
   of characters as the Identifier.

   The production MemberExpression : MemberExpression [ Expression ] is
   evaluated as follows:

   1.  Evaluate MemberExpression.
   2.  Call GetValue(Result(1)).
   3.  Evaluate Expression.
   4.  Call GetValue(Result(3)).
   5.  Call ToObject(Result(2)).
   6.  Call ToString(Result(4)).
   7.  Return a value of type Reference whose base object is Result(5) and
   whose property name is Result(6).

   The production CallExpression : CallExpression [ Expression ] is evaluated
   in exactly the same manner, except that the contained CallExpression is
   evaluated in step 1.

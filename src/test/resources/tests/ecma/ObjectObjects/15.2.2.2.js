   ECMA Section:       15.2.2.2 new Object()
   Description:

   When the Object constructor is called with no argument, the following
   step is taken:

   1.  Create a new native ECMAScript object.
   The [[Prototype]] property of the newly constructed object is set to
   the Object prototype object.

   The [[Class]] property of the newly constructed object is set
   to "Object".

   The newly constructed object has no [[Value]] property.

   Return the newly created native object.

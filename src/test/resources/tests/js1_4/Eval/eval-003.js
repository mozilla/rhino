/**
 *  File Name:    eval-003.js
 *  Description:  (SEE REVISED DESCRIPTION FURTHER BELOW)
 *
 *  The global eval function may not be accessed indirectly and then called.
 *  This feature will continue to work in JavaScript 1.3 but will result in an
 *  error in JavaScript 1.4. This restriction is also in place for the With and
 *  Closure constructors.

 * 
 *  Indirect eval IS NOT ILLEGAL per ECMA3!!!  See
 *
 *  http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38512
 *
 *  ------- Additional Comments From Brendan Eich 2001-01-30 17:12 -------
 * ECMA-262 Edition 3 doesn't require implementations to throw EvalError,
 * see the short, section-less Chapter 16.  It does say an implementation that
 * doesn't throw EvalError must allow assignment to eval and indirect calls
 * of the evalnative method.

/**
 * This class describes the support needed to implement security.
 * <p>
 * Three main pieces of functionality are required to implement
 * security for JavaScript. First, it must be possible to define
 * classes with an associated security domain. (This security
 * domain may be any object incorporating notion of access
 * restrictions that has meaning to an embedding; for a client-side
 * JavaScript embedding this would typically be
 * java.security.ProtectionDomain or similar object depending on an
 * origin URL and/or a digital certificate.)
 * Next it must be possible to get a security domain object that
 * allows a particular action only if all security domains
 * associated with code on the current Java stack allows it. And
 * finally, it must be possible to execute script code with
 * associated security domain injected into Java stack.
 * <p>
 * These three pieces of functionality are encapsulated in the
 * SecurityController class.
 *
 * @see org.mozilla.javascript.Context#setSecurityController(SecurityController)
 * @see java.lang.ClassLoader
 * @since 1.5 Release 4

     * Sets a named const property in this object.
     * <p>
     * The property is specified by a string name
     * as defined for <code>Scriptable.get</code>.
     * <p>
     * The possible values that may be passed in are as defined for
     * <code>Scriptable.get</code>. A class that implements this method may choose
     * to ignore calls to set certain properties, in which case those
     * properties are effectively read-only.<p>
     * For properties defined in a prototype chain,
     * use <code>putProperty</code> in ScriptableObject. <p>
     * Note that if a property <i>a</i> is defined in the prototype <i>p</i>
     * of an object <i>o</i>, then evaluating <code>o.a = 23</code> will cause
     * <code>set</code> to be called on the prototype <i>p</i> with
     * <i>o</i> as the  <i>start</i> parameter.
     * To preserve JavaScript semantics, it is the Scriptable
     * object's responsibility to modify <i>o</i>. <p>
     * This design allows properties to be defined in prototypes and implemented
     * in terms of getters and setters of Java values without consuming slots
     * in each instance.
     * <p>
     * The values that may be set are limited to the following:
     * <UL>
     * <LI>java.lang.Boolean objects</LI>
     * <LI>java.lang.String objects</LI>
     * <LI>java.lang.Number objects</LI>
     * <LI>org.mozilla.javascript.Scriptable objects</LI>
     * <LI>null</LI>
     * <LI>The value returned by Context.getUndefinedValue()</LI>
     * </UL><p>
     * Arbitrary Java objects may be wrapped in a Scriptable by first calling
     * <code>Context.toObject</code>. This allows the property of a JavaScript
     * object to contain an arbitrary Java object as a value.<p>
     * Note that <code>has</code> will be called by the runtime first before
     * <code>set</code> is called to determine in which object the
     * property is defined.
     * Note that this method is not expected to traverse the prototype chain,
     * which is different from the ECMA [[Put]] operation.
     * @param name the name of the property
     * @param start the object whose property is being set
     * @param value value to set the property to
     * @see org.mozilla.javascript.Scriptable#has(String, Scriptable)

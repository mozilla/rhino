*     Fix invalid JavaDoc links
*     Replace StringBuffer with StringBuilder if possible
*     Address review comments from hns
*     Generators save and later restore the current stack when processing the 'yield' operation. Our current implementation for restoring the stack unfortunately confuses the Java classfile verifier, so at class load time a VerifierError is thrown. This happens because the verifier can no longer ensure that the proper types are placed on the stack, since the stack-state is saved in a simple Object[]. Re-ordering a few operations is only necessary so the verifier will again accept the generated class. But this is only done for generators because it creates slightly less efficient code compared to the standard case.
*     Add doctest and update comments with proper bug number
*     Patch for Bug 782363 ("Increment/Decrement alters const variables")

# Rhino 1.7R5
## January 29, 2015

André Bargull (24):

*     Add missing license header to DefineClassMapInheritance.java
*     Remove invalid UTF-8 encoded unicode replacement characters (EF BF BD)
*     Add missing entries
*     Bug 772011: Decompiler does not add curly brackets for labelled statements
*     Add fix for bug-772833 (comment copied over from Parser::condExpr1 in frontend/Parser.cpp)
*     Fix bug 686806:     - trailing commas aren't allowed in object/array literals per JSON spec     - avoid using Integer.parseInt() to parse unicode escape sequences since parseInt() also accepts non-ASCII digits     - also avoid using Character.isDigit() in readNumber() for the very same reason     - readString() always created a StringBuilder instance to collect the input data, obviously this is actually only necessary when the input contains escaped characters. Therefore I've changed readString() to take the same approach as used in jsonparser.cpp     - the JSON number specification is stricter than Double.parseDouble(), for example Double.parseDouble() accepts the input string '10.'. To ensure only valid JSON number literals are passed to Double.parseDouble(), readNumber() was refactored to perform the necessary input validation.
*     Patch for bug 774083.
*     Patch for Bug 688023:
*     Fix broken test cases which relied on the old (and erroneous) toSource() output
*     Patch bug 685403
*     Patch for bug 637811:
*     Fix bug 773573: Search for first curly bracket after closing parentheses to take account of object destructuring parameters
*     Simple doctest for bug 773573
*     Array.prototype.sort performed an unchecked cast from long to int without any overflow checks, this may result in a negative length which then throws a NegativeArraySizeException in Java, cf. js1_5/Array/regress-157652.js . A similar problem was found in NativeJSON, so I've handled that as well
*     Add explicit cast to int to ensure previous behaviour is retained
*     Calls must not be special-calls and reference-calls at the same time, cf. js1_5/Regress/regress-319391.js for a test case
*     Enable js1_5/Regress/regress-319391.js for MozillaSuiteTest
*     Patch for Bug 728286
*     Add test case
*     Patch for Bug 778549
*     Add missing overflow detection when processing RegExp character class pattern
*     Patch for Bug 780147:
*     Patch for Bug 608235 ("Incorrect error message for undefined[undefined]")
*     Patch for Bug 784358 ("Defining const variable within eval() throws redeclaration error")

# Rhino 1.7.12
## January 13, 2020

### XML external entities disabled by default

As of this release, Rhino makes "XML external entity injections" more difficult
by disabling fetching of external DTDs and stylesheets by default,
as recommended in the [OWASP Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/master/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.md). 
Even though this may break some existing projects, the fact that this
vulnerability is in the OWASP top 10 makes it important enough to change
the default.

Developers who still need this old capability can re-enable it by setting the
Context feature flag FEATURE_ENABLE_XML_SECURE_PARSING to false. (The default
is true.)

### New JAR for embedding use cases

This release also includes a second JAR artifact, "rhino-runtime.jar". This is
simply the existing Rhino JAR with the "tools" source directory excluded. 
This directory includes the Rhino shell as well as the default "Global" 
object, which includes capabilities to load and process external source
code.

Since some automated source-scanning tools mark these capabilties as insecure,
this new JAR provides a way to only include the parts of Rhino that embedders
typically need without pulling in additional capabilities.

Developers who typically embed "rhino.jar" might consider embedding "rhino-runtime.jar"
instead if they do not need all this.

# Rhino 1.7.11
## May 30, 2019

This release includes implementations of a number of missing JavaScript language features,
including:

* Improvement to the accuracy and reliability of the parser and its associated AST.
* The Map, Set, WeakMap, and WeakSet classes.
* More Array functions, including from, of, fill, keys, values, entries, and copyWithin.
* Many more Math methods.
* More Object functions, including seal and freeze.
* Many other bug fixes, as shown below.

In general, Rhino's philosophy for new features and changes is to
follow the ECMAScript spec, but to use the "language version" on the Context class
when backward compatibility would be broken.

For example, the Array.prototype.concat function in older versions of Rhino would treat
any input value as "spreadable" if it has the same constructor as Array. ECMAScript now says
clearly that this should only happen if the "isConcatSpreadable" symbol is present. In
this release, the old behavior is disable when the language level is at least the
"ES6" level (Context.VERSION_ES6, or 200).

Developers working on new code will be happier if they set the language level to
CONTEXT.VERSION_ES6, or use the "-version 200" flag to the command line tool.

A future release will change the default language version of the command line tool.

This release contains contributions from 15 developers. Thanks for all your hard work!

# Rhino 1.7.10
## April 9, 2018

This release fixes a regression introduced in version 1.7.7.2 that caused the
"propertyIsEnumerable" to throw an exception when used with String and typed array objects,
and possibly with custom user-written objects as well.

It contains a few other fixes:

Attila Szegedi (2):
*     Make as many CallFrame fields as possible final, initialize them in constructor
*     frame.debuggerFrame != null || frame.idata.itsNeedActivation is identical to frame.useActivation.

*     Missing properties are not enumerable when checking enumerability

# Rhino 1.7.9
## March 15, 2018

This release fixes a [potential ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/390)
that was introduced in 1.7.8. Since it's potentially pretty serious, projects currently using 1.7.8
should switch to this new release.

[Issue 390](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/390)

In addition, there is a new flag on Context called "FEATURE_INTEGER_WITHOUT_DECIMAL_PLACE."
If set, Rhino will work harder to display numbers in integer form rather than in floating-point
form. This feature is currently disabled by default, although if it proves popular than we can
consider enabling it in the future.

[PR 398](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/pull/398)

At language level "ES6" and above, ToNumber conversion is now more compliant to the spec. (This
change is disabled for older language levels to prevent a problem with backward compatibility.)

[PR 383](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/pull/383)

Finally, there are a number of other fixes.

Thanks to all who contributed, both with issues and with code!

Attila Szegedi:
*     Fix a JavaDoc warning

Ivan Vyshnevskyi:
*     Make ToNumber(String) conversion more spec-compliant
*     Report parsing error for default values in destructuring assignments

Michael[tm] Smith:
*     Add addError(String messageId, int c) method
*     Add “illegal character” test to ParserTest
*     Show word in “identifier is a reserved word” error
*     Add “identifier is a reserved word” test

Oleksandr Maksymenko:
*     changes to process integer object as integer and long as long, not as double

RBRi:
*     cleanup the code an try to make it faster (#373)

jhertel:
*     Correction: Compatability → Compatibility

# Rhino 1.7.8
## January 22, 2018

Most important changes in this release:

* JavaScript objects are no longer (somewhat) thread-safe by default
* Rhino is resistant to "hash flooding" attacks
* Rhino is only supported for Java 8 and up
* Rhino only builds with Gradle.

The primary change in this release is that the object storage format has changed
for objects derived from ScriptableObject (which is nearly all objects).

First, objects are no longer thread-safe by default. (They were thread-safe previously, but
not in a way that we could prove was 100 percent correct in all cases.) We do not believe
that the vast majority of Rhino code depended on this capability. 

The feature flag Context.FEATURE_THREAD_SAFE_OBJECTS may be used to enable locking on all
objects by default in case it is needed. Furthermore, the built-in "sync" function is still
supported, which can be used to wrap a function in a similar way to the "synchronized" keyword
in Java.

Second, when an object grows to a large number of properties, the native hash table implementation
is replaced with java.util.HashMap. This more complex (but slightly slower) hash implementation
is resistant to hash collisions. This makes Rhino in general resistant to "hash flooding" attacks.

Rhino now depends on Java 8. It also works on Java 9, although a few tests are currently breaking
around Date parsing and UTF-8 encoding.

[Issue 341](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/341) Objects are only thread-safe when

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

many more tests.

# Rhino 1.7.7.2
## August 24, 2017

This release contains fixes for a few important bugs that have caught Rhino users out in the
field.

* Do not throw a Java exception from array.prototype.sort() no matter how weird the user-supplied
comparator function is. This is a major difference between JavaScript and Java and has caused
us to avoid using "Arrays.sort" on JavaScript arrays.
* Fix incorrect offsets in the "DataView" class.

It also includes several other fixes:

* Always append a column number to V8-style stack traces. (Unfortunately it is always "0".)
* Support Object.is and Object.assign.
* Make the Symbol implementation match the spec (for VERSION_ES6 and up only).
* Avoid throwing internal Java exceptions for certain native objects in "toJSON".
* Allow subclassing of ContinuationPending.
* For VERSION_ES6 and up, sort properties in the spec-defined order (int property names
first).
* Fix stack overflow in string concatenation.
* Improve performance of ConsString.toString

The next release is likely to be 1.7.8.

# Rhino 1.7.7.1
## February 2, 2016

* Improve String.prototype.repeat to work more efficiently and to not overflow
* Fix CallSite.isNative() and isTopLevel() so that they do not throw fatal errors
* Replace the implementation of the "YearFromTime" internal method for the Date class to avoid large CPU loops

Specific Changes:

*     Formatting issue with SourceReader.
*     Fix CallSite.isNative() and isTopLevel() to not throw.
*     Make String.prototype.repeat not overflow for large values, and change code style a bit.
*     Add tests from 1.7.7.
*     Add Gradle code from 1.7.7.
*     Replace YearFromTime with code from jsdate.cpp to avoid long CPU loops.

* [Issue 178](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/178) Support build using Gradle (build using Ant is still
supported but will be removed in a future release.)
* [Issue 176](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/176) Add ScriptRuntime.throwCustomError to make it easier
to re-throw Java exceptions
* [Issue 166](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/166) Support many ES6 additions to the Math class.

*     Generators save and later restore the current stack when processing the 'yield' operation. Our current implementation for restoring the stack unfortunately confuses the Java classfile verifier, so at class load time a VerifierError is thrown. This happens because the verifier can no longer ensure that the proper types are placed on the stack, since the stack-state is saved in a simple Object[]. Re-ordering a few operations is only necessary so the verifier will again accept the generated class. But this is only done for generators because it creates slightly less efficient code compared to the standard case.

# Rhino 1.7R5
## January 29, 2015

André Bargull (24):

*     Add missing license header to DefineClassMapInheritance.java
*     Remove invalid UTF-8 encoded unicode replacement characters (EF BF BD)
*     Add missing entries
*     Bug 772011: Decompiler does not add curly brackets for labelled statements
*     Add fix for bug-772833 (comment copied over from Parser::condExpr1 in frontend/Parser.cpp)
*     Fix bug 686806:     - trailing commas aren't allowed in object/array literals per JSON spec     - avoid using Integer.parseInt() to parse unicode escape sequences since parseInt() also accepts non-ASCII digits     - also avoid using Character.isDigit() in readNumber() for the very same reason     - readString() always created a StringBuilder instance to collect the input data, obviously this is actually only necessary when the input contains escaped characters. Therefore I've changed readString() to take the same approach as used in jsonparser.cpp     - the JSON number specification is stricter than Double.parseDouble(), for example Double.parseDouble() accepts the input string '10.'. To ensure only valid JSON number literals are passed to Double.parseDouble(), readNumber() was refactored to perform the necessary input validation.
*     Patch for bug 774083.
*     Patch for Bug 688023:
*     Fix broken test cases which relied on the old (and erroneous) toSource() output
*     Patch bug 685403
*     Patch for bug 637811:
*     Fix bug 773573: Search for first curly bracket after closing parentheses to take account of object destructuring parameters
*     Simple doctest for bug 773573
*     Array.prototype.sort performed an unchecked cast from long to int without any overflow checks, this may result in a negative length which then throws a NegativeArraySizeException in Java, cf. js1_5/Array/regress-157652.js . A similar problem was found in NativeJSON, so I've handled that as well
*     Add explicit cast to int to ensure previous behaviour is retained
*     Calls must not be special-calls and reference-calls at the same time, cf. js1_5/Regress/regress-319391.js for a test case
*     Enable js1_5/Regress/regress-319391.js for MozillaSuiteTest

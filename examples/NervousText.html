<body>
This is the NervousText applet in javascript:
<applet archive="js.jar" code=NervousText width=200 height=50 >
</applet>

<hr>
The test assumes that applet code is generated with:
<pre>
java -classpath js.jar org.mozilla.javascript.tools.jsc.Main \
  -extends java.applet.Applet \
  -implements java.lang.Runnable \
  NervousText.js
</pre>
and the resulting 2 classes, NervousText.class extending java.applet.Applet and implementing java.lang.Runnable and NervousText1.class which represents compiled JavaScript code, are placed in the same directory as NervousText.html.
<p>
The test also assumes that js.jar from Rhino distribution is available in the same directory.

   Description:        new PrototypeObject

   This tests Object Hierarchy and Inheritance, as described in the document
   Object Hierarchy and Inheritance in JavaScript, last modified on 12/18/97
   15:19:34 on http://devedge.netscape.com/.  Current URL:
   http://devedge.netscape.com/docs/manuals/communicator/jsobj/contents.htm

   This tests the syntax ObjectName.prototype = new PrototypeObject using the
   Employee example in the document referenced above.

   If you add a property to an object in the prototype chain, instances of
   objects that derive from that prototype should inherit that property, even
   if they were instatiated after the property was added to the prototype object.

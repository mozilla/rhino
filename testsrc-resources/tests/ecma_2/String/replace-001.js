/*
 * If regexp is not an object of type RegExp, it is replaced with the
 * result of the expression new RegExp(regexp).  Let string denote the
 * result of converting the this value to a string.  String is searched
 * for the first occurrence of the regular expression pattern regexp if
 * regexp.global is false, or all occurrences if regexp.global is true.
 *
 * The match is performed as in String.prototype.match, including the
 * update of regexp.lastIndex.  Let m be the number of matched
 * parenthesized subexpressions as specified in section 15.7.5.3.
 *
 * If replaceValue is a function, then for each matched substring, call
 * the function with the following m + 3 arguments. Argument 1 is the
 * substring that matched. The next m arguments are all of the matched
 * subexpressions. Argument m + 2 is the length of the left context, and
 * argument m + 3 is string.
 *
 * The result is a string value derived from the original input by
 * replacing each matched substring with the corresponding return value
 * of the function call, converted to a string if need be.
 *
 * Otherwise, let newstring denote the result of converting replaceValue
 * to a string. The result is a string value derived from the original
 * input string by replacing each matched substring with a string derived
 * from newstring by replacing characters in newstring by replacement text
 * as specified in the following table:
 *
 * $& The matched substring.
 * $‘ The portion of string that precedes the matched substring.
 * $’ The portion of string that follows the matched substring.
 * $+ The substring matched by the last parenthesized subexpressions in
 *      the regular expression.
 * $n The corresponding matched parenthesized subexpression n, where n
 * is a single digit 0-9. If there are fewer than n subexpressions, “$n
 * is left unchanged.
 *
 * Note that the replace function is intentionally generic; it does not
 * require that its this value be a string object. Therefore, it can be
 * transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

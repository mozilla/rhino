/**
   File Name:          15.2.1.2.js
   ECMA Section:       15.2.1.2  The Object Constructor Called as a Function:
   Object(value)
   Description:        When Object is called as a function rather than as a
   constructor, the following steps are taken:

   1.  If value is null or undefined, create and return a
   new object with no proerties other than internal
   properties exactly as if the object constructor
   had been called on that same value (15.2.2.1).
   2.  Return ToObject (value), whose rules are:

   undefined   generate a runtime error
   null        generate a runtime error
   boolean     create a new Boolean object whose default
   value is the value of the boolean.
   number      Create a new Number object whose default
   value is the value of the number.
   string      Create a new String object whose default
   value is the value of the string.
   object      Return the input argument (no conversion).

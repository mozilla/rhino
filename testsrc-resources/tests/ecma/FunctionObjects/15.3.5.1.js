/**
   File Name:          15.3.5.1.js
   ECMA Section:       Function.length
   Description:

   The value of the length property is usually an integer that indicates the
   "typical" number of arguments expected by the function.  However, the
   language permits the function to be invoked with some other number of
   arguments. The behavior of a function when invoked on a number of arguments
   other than the number specified by its length property depends on the function.

   this test needs a 1.2 version check.

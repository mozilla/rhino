   File Name:          7.7.3-2.js
   ECMA Section:       7.7.3 Numeric Literals

   Description:

   This is a regression test for
   http://scopus.mcom.com/bugsplat/show_bug.cgi?id=122884

   Waldemar's comments:

   A numeric literal that starts with either '08' or '09' is interpreted as a
   decimal literal; it should be an error instead.  (Strictly speaking, according
   to ECMA v1 such literals should be interpreted as two integers -- a zero
   followed by a decimal number whose first digit is 8 or 9, but this is a bug in
   ECMA that will be fixed in v2.  In any case, there is no place in the grammar
   where two consecutive numbers would be legal.)

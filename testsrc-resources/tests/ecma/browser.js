 * test js file in script tags.

 * The source of the page that is generated should look something like this:

 * before the failure reporting code could run. In order
 * to be able to capture errors for the "negative" case 
 * where the exception is a sign the test actually passed,
 * the err online handler will assume that any error is a 
 * failure unless gExceptionExpected is true.

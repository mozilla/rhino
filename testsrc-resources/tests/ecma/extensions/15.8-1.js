/**
   File Name:          15.8-1.js
   ECMA Section:       15.8 The Math Object

   Description:

   The Math object is merely a single object that has some named properties,
   some of which are functions.

   The value of the internal [[Prototype]] property of the Math object is the
   Object prototype object (15.2.3.1).

   The Math object does not have a [[Construct]] property; it is not possible
   to use the Math object as a constructor with the new operator.

   The Math object does not have a [[Call]] property; it is not possible to
   invoke the Math object as a function.

   Recall that, in this specification, the phrase "the number value for x" has
   a technical meaning defined in section 8.5.

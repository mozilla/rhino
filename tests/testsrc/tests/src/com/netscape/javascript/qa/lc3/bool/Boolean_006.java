/**
 *  3.4 Preferred Argument Conversions
 *  3.4.2 Boolean.
 *  Given a Java object that has several ambiguous methods, if JavaScript calls
 *  the ambiguous method with a boolean, the order of preference should be as
 *  follows, regardless of the order in which the methods are declared.
 *  boolean
 *  java.lang.Boolean
 *  java.lang.Object
 *  java.lang.String
 *  long, int, short, char, byte
 *  double, float
 *
 *  In this case, the expected result depends on the specific method that is
 *  invoked.  Invoking with using explicit method invocation results in a 
 *  runtime error.
